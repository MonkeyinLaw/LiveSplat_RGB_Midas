LiveSplat was developed as a small part of a larger proprietary VR telerobotics system. I posted a video of the Gaussian splatting component of this system Reddit and many people expressed an interest in experimenting with it themselves. So I spun it out and called it LiveSplat and now I'm making it publicly available (see installation instructions below).  

LiveSplat should be considered alpha level. I do not have the resources to test the installation on many different machines, so let me know if the application does not run on yours (assuming your machine meets the requirements).

I've decided to keep the application closed source in order to explore potential business opportunities involving this technology. If you are a business wanting to integrate this technology, please email mark@axby.cc.  

I hope you have fun with LiveSplat!
